**Project description**
This project will be carried out within Telecommunications Research Laboratory (TRLab) at HUEE.

Wi-Fi is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access.

Wi-Fi has different versions specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards and commonly uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands.

At close range, Wi-Fi can achieve data speeds of over 1 Gbit/s. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for line-of-sight use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances, etc. may greatly reduce the achievable range.

In this project, a portable long-range Wi-Fi network operating in the 5 GHz radio band will be developed. A Raspberry Pi-like embed system and a 802.11ac modem will be the possible hardware that you will use. To increase the coverage range, the mesh network topology is preferred, therefore the modem will be configured in the adhoc network mode, and the protocols will be adapted accordingly. The system will be carried by personnel and used as an access point (or hotspot), hence it should be lightweight, yet the signal power should be strong enough.

**Design constraints and the requirements of the project**
The network should support:
- mesh network topology with at least 6 users,
- 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands,
- a coverage range of upto 200 m outdoor with the 5 GHz band,
- a coverage range of upto 20 m indoor with the 5 GHz band,
The system can be used as an access point (or hotspot), and it should be compatible with the 802.11 ac standard.
WPA2 encryption, and AES 128/256 encryption are preferred.
The maximum antenna length shall be 40 cm. The maximum weight shall be 400g including the antenna."
